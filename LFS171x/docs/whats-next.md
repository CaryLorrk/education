## Hyperledger Community

The development of the Hyperledger projects is led by a diverse group of technical, open source contributors. We are always looking for help to build an open source ecosystem of business blockchain technologies. If you are interested in contributing to and learning from the community, we welcome you to [join the Hyperledger effort](https://www.hyperledger.org/community).

## Joining the Hyperledger Community

You too can join the Hyperledger Community:
- **For developers**
Read the Hyperledger code on GitHub. Join the Hyperledger discussion at Rocket.Chat. Search for open bugs, or report a new one in the Hyperledger’s bug database.
- **For business leaders**
For key updates from Hyperledger, join the mailing list. Explore all Hyperledger business solutions.
- **For educators and community leaders**
You can start or join a Hyperledger meetup. Development updates from Wiki can be found here.

## Hyperledger Working Groups

The Hyperledger Community’s working groups are open to the public. Developers and tech leaders can engage with any of the Hyperledger’s open community channels at this [page](https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/wiki/PublicMeetingCalendar).

Below, you can see an overview of Hyperledger’s working groups.

If you are interested in getting involved in the Hyperledger community, we've set up a web page that provides information about the different ways in which you can participate.
This web page is at hyperledger.org/community.
So, as you can see from this page, there are a number of different ways to get involved.
The first way is through the mailing lists.
If we click on this first link, you will be taken to a page that shows all of the mailing lists that are available for Hyperledger.
As you can see from the list, we have mailing lists for each of the different working groups that we have within Hyperledger,
as well as a separate mailing list for each of the projects.
Each mailing list is archived, so that you can see past messages.
You can self-subscribe to any of these mailing lists that you are interested in.
So, the next item that we have is a link to the different projects that exist within Hyperledger.
So, if we click on this, we can see a list of all of the different Hyperledger frameworks and Hyperledger tools that exist.
Each of these projects has a separate web page, with links to source code, documentation, and other information specific to that project.
Next, we have a number of different meetups that meet around the world.
So, when we click on this link, we'll go to the meet up.com site.
Here you can see that we have meetings in 32 different countries around the world, approaching 20,000 members [as of October 2017] that are participating in these different meetups.
So, if you don't see a pin close to you, and you are interested in starting a meetup to discuss Hyperledger with those around you,
please contact us at info@hyperledger.org, and we will help you get started.
The next link that we have is Rocket.Chat. Rocket.Chat is an open source alternative to Slack.
We have a number of different channels that are set up to focus on the working groups and individual projects within Hyperledger.
You can use this search box to search for different channels related to different projects.
So, for example, we can type in 'fabric' here, and see all of the different channels that are related to the Hyperledger Fabric project.
We can also do the same thing for Sawtooth, and see all of the different channels related to Hyperledger Sawtooth.
So, Rocket.Chat requires that you have a Linux Foundation ID, which is free and can be obtained at identity.linuxfoundation.org.
So, going back to the community page, we see that the next thing that we have is a code of conduct.
So, this code of conduct is a page that I won't read, but basically says "Be nice and respect others' opinions."
Obviously, it has a lot more in it, so please feel free to read that.
The next thing that we have is working groups. We will be taken to the Hyperledger wiki, which shows us the different working groups that exist.
The first that you see on this list is the Technical Steering Committee. So, the TSC meets on a weekly basis, and provides technical governance for Hyperledger and its projects.
The Architecture Working Group is focused on looking at the architecture across the different Hyperledger projects.
The Requirements Working Group is developing a library of use cases for how people are using business blockchain technologies.
The Identity Working Group is focused on identity on the blockchain, as well as the identity of entities involved in a blockchain network.
The Performance and Scale Working Group is focused on being able to measure the performance of the different blockchain frameworks. The Whitepaper Working Group is writing a whitepaper that explains what Hyperledger is. The Healthcare Working Group is an industry-specific working group. We also have a technical working group located in China that meets on a bi-weekly basis at a China-friendly time. All of these working groups are open to anyone to join and participate.

The next thing that we'll see here is our bug-tracking database.
So, if we look at the bug-tracking database, we can see that we have all of the different projects captured,
and we're using JIRA for this bug-tracking database.
So, you can use JIRA for viewing existing bugs within the system, or to report a bug that you have found.
The JIRA system also requires that you have a Linux Foundation ID.
Lastly on the community page, we'll see and be taken back to the wiki.
So, the wiki has information about the different projects, the working groups, governing documents for how we work within Hyperledger, and it also has information on the different ways that we communicate, which we've already talked about.
The one interesting thing that I want to point out here is this calendar of public meetings.
Through this page, you can get to this Google Calendar, which lists all of the different meetings that we have, and information about how you can participate in those meetings.
Because this is an open community, all of these different meetings are open to anyone who wants to join.
We look forward to seeing you within the Hyperledger community.
